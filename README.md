## Requirements Met and Bonus Features
âœ… <u>**Implement the app using JavaScript classes**</u>: **Expense**, **Category** and **Tracker**. Each expense have the following attributes: date (automatically assigned or manually entered), category (selected from predefined categories or custom), description and amount.

âœ… <u>**Data Persistence**</u>: We have used **IndexedDB** to save the spending data and we use **LocalStorage** for save the predefined categories and the user can save the custom categories.

âœ… <u>**CRUD**</u>: You can create, read, update and delete the expense data and this information is saved in IndexedDB.

âœ… <u>**Chart.js**</u> You can see a line chart showing expenses over time, a bar chart showing the breakdown of expenses by category and a card with total amount information.
